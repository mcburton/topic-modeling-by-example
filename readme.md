# Topic Modeling by Example

This repository contains the materials for a topic modeling tutorial. There is a presentation, `intro-to-tm.ipynb`, and a step by step walkthrough, `running-MALLET.ipynb`. Both are composed as [IPython Notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) and can be executed or viewed as read-only on Github.


- [Introduction to Topic Modeling](intro-to-topic-modeling.ipynb) is an IPython Slide show that provides a conceptual introduction to topic modeling. For a more extensive discussion please see my blog post [The Joy of Topic Modeling](http://mcburton.net/blog/joy-of-tm/). This presentation includes some valuable links at the end.
- [Running MALLET](running-MALLET.ipynb) documents the commands one would use to train a topic model on a set of documents contained in the `data/` directory.
- [The data directory](data) contains around 200 text files which are blog posts scraped from the DHNow Editor's Choice index.
