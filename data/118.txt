From all of us at Digital Humanities Now, happy holidays and best wishes for the new year!
We will return in January to bring you more digital humanities scholarship, conversations, news, and events.
In the meantime, we invite you to participate in this experiment in digital publishing. Please tell us how we can improve Digital Humanities Now in the upcoming year.
