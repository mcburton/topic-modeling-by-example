Over at Off Paper (the arts journal for Seattle’s Project Room), I have a new piece titled, “Making Things in the Digital Humanities.”
The piece is my attempt at not only explaining DH research to an arts audience but also articulating a kind of making that doesn’t imply mastery, do-it-yourself individualism, or a writing-building dichotomy. Plus, it’s an opportunity to stress the transformation of writing in higher education and elsewhere.
Feedback welcome!
